# BIO226

# Evolutionary ecological genomics and molecular adaptation

# Dates : 6 - 28th November 2018

# Location : Villa of the Botanischer Garten der Universität Zürich Zollikerstrasse 107 8008 Zürich

### General description

This course offers students a review of current theoretical and methodological advances in the application and analysis of genomic data for addressing evolutionary questions at the population level and at the interface of populations and species, with an emphasis on practical data analysis skills. Through lectures, paper discussions, and interactive computer labs, students will learn the advantages and limitations of specific types of genomic data and methods (e.g. AFLPs, SSRs, SNPs/NGS data, etc.) and they will be provided with an introduction to a variety of powerful software packages for data analysis. Specific topics covered in the course will focus on the application of multi-locus data for estimating population genetic parameters, analysing population structure and differentiation, inter-population relationships, demography, gene flow, finding loci under selection, and understanding the molecular basis of adaptations.

{ ### ECTS 6 }

## Learning Outcome
On completion of the course, students should be able to 1) recognize the strengths and weaknesses of various types of genomic data, 2) analyze genome-wide data using modern software packages 3) design research studies utilizing the genomics tools covered in the course

## Key skills

On completion of the course, students should be able to 1) assess the conclusions of previously published literature 2) synthesize their knowledge through the completion of group projects based on previously published data 3) present the results of group projects both in writing and orally to promote fellow students’ understanding
